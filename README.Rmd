# Analysis of land designations that contribute to conservation

This repository contains R code that calculates summaries of the amount of land 
designated in B.C. that contributes to conservation. It supports this 
[Environmental Reporting BC indicator]().

## Usage

### R packages required:

Other than `bcmaps`*, all required packages are available from CRAN

- rgdal
- sp
- rgeos
- raster
- maptools
- bcmaps *(install with `devtools::install_github("bcgov/bcmaps")`)
- geojsonio
- rmapshaper
- feather
- readr
- dplyr
- tidyr
- ggplot2
- ggpolypath

### Data

Input data is obtained by running the python script [here](https://github.com/bcgov/designatedlands) using the following commands:
  
```
## Download the Biogeoclimatic Zone layer from here: 
## https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/biogeoclimatic-ecosystem-classification-bec-map
## and store it in your working directory

## Download the Ecosection layer from here: 
## https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/ecosections-ecoregion-ecosystem-classification-of-british-columbia
## and store it in your working directory

python designatedlands.py create_db

python designatedlands.py load

python designatedlands.py process

python designatedlands.py dump --out_file=designatedlands.gpkg

python designatedlands.py overlay BEC_BIOGEOCLIMATIC_POLY.gdb --in_layer=WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION_BEC_BIOGEOCLIMATIC_POLY_polygon --new_layer_name=bec

python designatedlands.py overlay ERC_ECOSECTIONS_SP.gdb --in_layer=WHSE_TERRESTRIAL_ECOLOGY_ERC_ECOSECTIONS_SP_polygon --new_layer_name=eco

python designatedlands.py dump --out_table=bec_overlay --out_file=lands_bec.gpkg --aggregate_fields="bc_boundary,designation,category,zone,subzone,variant,phase,map_label"

python designatedlands.py dump --out_table=eco_overlay --out_file=lands_eco.gpkg --aggregate_fields="bc_boundary,designation,category,parent_ecoregion_code,ecosection_code,ecosection_name"

```
The outputs from that script should be:

- `designatedlands.gpkg` - the land designations layer
- `lands_bec.gpkg` - the land designations layer intersected with BEC (using the `overlay` command in the conservationlands tool)
- `lands_eco.gpkg`- the land designations layer intersected with ecosections (using the `overlay` command in the conservationlands tool)

Place these in the `data` folder of this repository. You will also require `BEC_BIOGEOCLIMATIC_POLY.gdb` from [here](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/biogeoclimatic-ecosystem-classification-bec-map) and 
`ERC_ECOSECTIONS_SP.gdb` from [here](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/ecosections-ecoregion-ecosystem-classification-of-british-columbia)

The [`data-raw`](data-raw) folder contains a file [`sources.csv`](data-raw/sources.csv) that lists all of the source
land designation layers used in the analysis.

### Running the analysis

- Run the `01_clean.R` file to prepare the data. Note that this will take a long time (several hours)
- Run the `02_analysis.R` file to calculate the summaries. 
- Summary csv files are copied to the `out` directory, and summary objects for use
in the [land designations Shiny app](https://github.com/bcgov/land-designations-shinyapp)
are copied to the `out-shiny` directory.
- The `output.R` file will copy the files from `out-shiny` to the 
`../land-designations-shinyapp/app/data` folder, assuming the folder exists in 
same parent directory as this repository

## Pathway to open source

Once the data are available, this repo will be moved to the bcgov org and 
developed in the open.
